A basic Japanese flash card program.

The program presents the user with a Japanese word, which they have to guess, before being presented with the English
word after 5 seconds.
If the user got it right, they click on the checkmark, and if they got it wrong, they should click on the cross. 
The words the user failed to get correct, or hadn't been presented with yet, will be saved to a new csv file, 
which will be loaded the next time the program is loaded.
