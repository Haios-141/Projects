The coffee machine has a finite amount of resources, which can be changed in the data.py file. These resources will be
deducted when any type of coffee is made.

When prompted, other than normal operations to make coffee, the user can enter the following "hidden" commands;

report - to show a list of the current state of the resources.

off - to turn off the machine.
